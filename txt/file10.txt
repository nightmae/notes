        TTG
        We have derived the Lorenz Gauge in the previous notes, now we will get the transeverse traceless gauge.
        Polarization is the geometric orientation of waves
        The Polarization of the electric field vector E in an electroamgnetic field can be horizontal or vertical,
        It can also be circular or diagonal.
        
        Electromagnetic waves are osciliations in the E and B vector fields.
        Polarization = direction of E vector
        This means that Gravitational Waves are oscilations in the metric pertrubation h_uv
        So in this case, 
        Polarization = Direction of how distances change between points.
        
        
        The Linear Metric h_uv has 16 components.
        There is a choice of coordinates where this reduces to only 2.
        These are the 2 polarizations of gravitational waves:
        "plus" (+) polarization, and
        "cross" (x) polarization
        
        This coordinate system is called the Transverse Tracless Gauge "TT"
        The most simple solutions to the d'Alembertain of h_uv are plane waves.
        Auv Are the Amplitudes (It is also Symmetric),
        kσ are the components of the Wave Co-vector,
        k_x/y/z are the angular wavenumbers,
        k_t = ω/c is the Angular frequency.
        
        Since the wave equation is linear,
        ◻(a1f1 + a2f2) = a1◻f1 + a2◻f2
        Any generic wave number can be written as a linear combination of plane waves of different frequencies
        The planes will have a constant spacing factor which will space them apart.
        
        The most straightforward solution to ◻ℏ_uv is:
        A cos (+(ω/c) ct - k^x x- k^y y - k^z z) =
        A cos (n_tt k^t ct + n_xx k^x x ...) =
        A cos (nuσ k^u x^σ) = 
        A cos (kσ x^σ) = 
        = Re[A e^{i(k_σ)x^σ}]
        k = k^u eu
        k^u are vector components
        
        k = k_σ ε^σ
        where k_σ are the co-vector components
        
        k^x/y/z are the angular wave-numbers
        A cos (...) = Re[A * e^i(n_uσ k^u x^σ)]
        
        The density in x = κ_x = 1/2pi k_x
        κ_x is the linear wavenumber
        k_x is the angular wavenumber
        
        So the density in ct = f/c = 1/2pi w/c
        So we get that:
        k = k^t ε^t + k_x ε^x
        => space x -> k = k^t et + k^x ex
        In flat spacetime/cartesian coordinates, 
        k_u = n_uv k^v
        
        k_t = +k^t
        k_x = -k^x 
        k_y = -k^y 
        k_z = -k^z
        
        More Generically,
        k_u = g_uv k^v
        As we know, the most straightforward sol. to ◻ℏ^uv are plane waves.
        ℏ_uv == A_uv cos(+ω/c ct - k^x x - k^y y - k^z z)
        ℏ_uv == Re[A_uv e^i(k_o x^σ)]
        ℏ_uv is Symmetric, so A_uv is also symmetric.
        
        If we take the derivative of a plane wave,
        ∂a(ℏ_uv) we get:
        ℏ_uv ik_a ∂a
        Wave co-vector must be a null/light-like geodesic where mag(k)^2 = 0, Since the wave travels at v=c.
        The Lorenz Condition, 0 = ∂b h^ab = ik_b A_ab e^ikσ x^σ 
        Also gives
        A^ab k_b = A_ab k^b = 0
        The columns of the wave amplitude "matrix" A^ab must also be orthogonal to the wave co-vector row k_b 
        
        => k_a k^a = mag(k)^2 = 0
        
        A_uv has 16 components,
        The Symmetry A_uv = A_vu reduces this to 10 unique components,
        Lorenz Gauge ∂b h^ab = 0 is not unique because:
        x^a = X^a --> X^a + ξ^a with ∂b h^ab =  ◻ξ^a
        
        A special LG called the "Transeverse Traceless Gauge" "TT" redices this from a further 6 components to 2.
        k_B A^ab = 0 gives 4 constraint equations aswell.
        
        We know that the Lorensz Gauge has coordinates x, a small displacement field xi, and a transformation rule.
        In the "TT" Gauge, "plus" and "cross" polarizations become VERY obvious.
        ◻X]^a = 0 gives us 4 degrees of freedom for X]^t/x/y/z
        
        As you know, we also have 4 degrees of freedom on A_uv, aswell as h_uv.
        3 of them will be "transverse", and 1 of them will be "traceless"
        
        
        We will know discuss the transverse constraints:
        -Take an observer with 4-velocity U = U^u eu who is experiencing gravitational waves
        -We want the gravitational waves to be at right angles (orthognal) to the observer.
        So, Auv U^u = 0
        Making the matrix A_uv dotted with the matrix U^u = a 1x4 matrix with all the components being 0.
        
        k^u Auv = 0, and Auv U^u = 0 have 1 shared constraint, with a total of 7 constraints.
        This makes
        Aut = 0 = Atu
        k^t Atv = 0 is already satisfied since Atv = 0
        So k^u Auv = 0 only gives us an extra thjree constraints.
        So, Auv U^u = 0 gives us 3 "transeverse" constraints, and we also have 1 extra "tracless" constraint.
        
        The Tracless constraint is:
        0 = Auv n^uv = Att - Axx - Ayy - Azz
        
        So, The "TT" Gauge is a special Lorenz Gauge where:
        ℏ_uv U^u = 0 = ℏ_u ^u
        U^u being the 4 velocity of the person observing the gravitational waves.
        
        A 4th constraint is for Auv to be "Traceless": A_u ^u = n^uv A_uv = 0
        This leaves us with 2 independant components.
        
        Take U = c et, so
        U^u = (c,0,0,0)
        Take k_B = (ω/c, 0, 0, ω/c)
        
        
        Avu U^u = 0 gives us
        Atv U^t = Atv c = 0
        => Atv = Avt = 0
        Auv k^u = 0 gives us
        Atv k^t + Azv k^z = 0
        0(+ω/c) + Azv(-ω/c) = 0
        => Azv - Avz = 0
        A^u _u = n^uv A_uv = 0 gives us
        => Axx = -Ayy
        And Axy = Ayx by symmetric.
        
        So these 2 independant components in the matrix give us cross and plus polarization, image above.
        k^u is travelling in the z-direction.
