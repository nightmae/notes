        How Cross/Plus polarization affects free particles in general relativity
        In the previous note's we derived:
        Einstein Field Equations, with all of it's components,
        Wave Equation,
        Weak Gravity,
        Lorenz Gauge,
        "Transeverse Traceless" Gauge,
        (+) and (x) Polarizations,
        
        And now we're reviewing how these polarizations affect particles in a free-state.
        We will assume vacuum T_uv|0>
        (u,v are mu and nu, i don't feel like copying them everytime i need to use them, which is very frequent)
        First image is what the matrices of the polarizations look like in LaTeX.
        
        As we know,
        ◻ħ_uv = 0, this is from the "TT" Gauge.
        
        In relativity, coordinate systems are arbitrary and do not affect our physics in the real world, a change of coordinate systems does make specific things easier to visualize/understand
        
        You may have wondered, what if ◻ħ_uv = 0 is just a result of wave-y gravitational waves?
        Real gravitational waves are spacestretched and compressed
        Meaning it could just be wave-y coordinate lines.
        
        Geodesics Recap
        -Geodesics are the paths that particles in a free-state take with no forces acting on them.
        -They are only affected by gravity (THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME NOT A 4-VECTOR F)
        -They do NOT depend on the coordinates
        
        L_0, Proper Length Recap
        -The proper length L0 measures the distance between two spacelike seperated points at a constant time.
        -Also does NOT depend on coordinates
        -Equation for L0 is:
        ∫mag(d/dλ) dλ
        where λ is the tangent-line path parametre
        
        Geodesics and Proper Length measure how gravitational waves stretch/compress space in a coordinate-independant way.
        
        We know that the geodesic equation is:
        (d^2 x^σ / dλ) Γ^σ _uv  (dx^u / dλ) (dx^u / dλ) = 0
        For massive particles we can assume proper-time tau = path-parametre λ
        
        -We can simplify this expression to:
        (dU^σ / dτ) =  Γ^σ _uv U^u U^v = 0
        There is a lot of Γ^σ _uv connection coefficients to calculate, so equations get complicated exponentially.
        but there is ONE set of solutions that is easy to verify.
        (dU^σ / dτ) +  Γ^σ _uv U^u U^v = 0
        (dU^σ / dτ) +  Γ^σ _tt U^t U^t = 0
        (dU^σ / dτ) + Γ^σ _tt c^2 = 0
        By the way,
        U(τ) = c(et)
        U^u(τ) = (c,0,0,0)
        U^t(τ) = c, U^i(τ) = 0
        
        This is "at rest" with respect to coordinates lines.
        The geodesic equation in weak gravity is a bit different from the one we derived, you can google it to find the formula.
        
        So this means that,
        1/c^2 (dU^σ / dτ) = -(Γ^σ _tt)
        the U derivative term goes to 0, so we get:
        0 = 0
        So this is a valid geodesic.
        
        
        We can get that x ^u = (cτ + b^t, b^x, b^y, b^z)
        Geodesic = a starting point, b^u, travelling forward in time at rate c
        We can NOT trust our eyes to measure distances in relativity, the length L0 could be changing, but it would not be noticable to us
        Instead we use things like basis-vectors and L0 to measure the distance.
        Visualize a plane wave travelling only in the z-direction,
        k^u = (w/c, 0, 0, w/c)
        h_uv = [....]e^i(kσ x^σ)
        Proper length L0 is changing, but it appears the same to our eyes.
        L0 = ∫mag(d/dλ) dλ
        We can calculate the proper length if we assume:
        x(λ) =v^x λ
        y(λ) = v^y λ
        
        We will start the derivation:
         L0 = ∫sqrt(-d/dλ * d/dλ) dλ
        L0 = ∫sqrt(-((dx/dλ ∂/∂x + (dy/dλ ∂/∂y) * (dx/dλ ∂/∂x + (dy/dλ ∂/∂y))) dλ
        L0 = ∫(0,1) sqrt(- (v^x)^2 g_xx + (v^x)(v^y) g_xy + (v_y)^2 g_yy) dλ
        L0 = ∫(0,1) sqrt(-vv) dλ
        L0 = mag(v)
        The Negative at the front makes the geodesic space-like
        v is a displacement vector
        
        #v v = v^u v^v g_uv
        It's also a spacelike vector, since
        d/dλ = dx^u/dλ ∂/∂x^u
        v = v^u (eu)
        
        So we get:
        (v^x v^x g_xx) + (v^x v^y g_xy) + (v^y v^x g_yx) + (v^y v^y g_yy)
        = (v^x)^2 gxx + 2(v^x v^y gxy) + (v^y)^2 gyy
