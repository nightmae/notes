        guv = nuv + huv
        gravitational waves happen at the huv part.
        We will cover linearized gravity in this thingy.
        in guv = nuv + huv,
        => nuv is equal to flat spacetime
        => gravitational waves are distributed in linearzed gravity in huv
        
        The weak gravity limit is that the magnitude of huv is <<1, so we can approximate it at 0.
        Our goal is to calculate that Guv = Ruv - 1/2 Rguv in Linearized Gravity.
        Aswell as the metric guv, all up to the Ricci Scalar.
        
        We will not be discussing the definition of weak gravity, as there is like a good wikipedia page on it.
        We will take that
        => h_ab * h_uv = 1 
        hab(∂σhuv) = 0
        
        Gravitational waves detected by the LIGO detector usually range from
        wavelength λ: 100s km - 1000s km, and
        period T: ~0.001s - ~0.01
        Usually, they dont oscilate very fast in terms of uv, so its reasonable to assume huv is very small.
        Magnitude is denoted by mag(), or ||||, with a term inbetween the first two and other two.
        guv = nuv + kuv
        guσ g^σv = δ^v <u 
        mag(huv/kuv) << 1
        0 = h_uσ n^σv + n_uσ k^σv + (h_uσ k^uσ (goes to zero))
        h_uσ n^σv = -n_uo k^σv
        g^uv = n^uv - h^uv
        h^uv (raised indices) = h_pσ n^pu n^σv 
        n/g^σv * n/g_uσ* = δ^v <u
        
        h^u <v = h_σv n^uv
        Γ^σ <uv = 1/2 g^σa (∂vgau + ∂ugav 0 ∂aguv)
        
        ==> Γ^σ <uv = 1/2 g^σa (∂vhau + ∂uhav 0 ∂ahuv)
        
        In Weak Gravity, mag(h^σa) << 1
        
        Γ^σ <uv = 1/2 n^σa (∂vhau + ∂uhav 0 ∂ahuv), for weak gravity
        
        Now, we will calculate the Riemann Curvature Tensor:
        R^p <σuv = ∂u(Γ^p <vσ) - ∂v(Γ^p <uσ) + 0 + 0
        R^p <σuv = 1/2 n^pa (∂u∂σhav - ∂u∂ahvσ - ∂v∂σ hau + ∂v∂a huo)
        If we expand some of the terms, we get
        Γ^y <vσ Γ^p <uy === n^ya n^pa (0,0,0,0...)
        
        Now we will calculate the Ricci Tensor, which is a summation of the riemannian curvature tensor
        R_σv = R^u <σuv
        We can use the inverse metric to raise the lower indicies, and combine like terms to get:
        R_σv = 1/2 ∂u∂σh^u <v - ∂^u∂ahvσ - ∂v∂σ h^u <u + ∂v∂a hao
        
        And then we get that
        R_σv = 1/2 ∂u∂σh^u <v - ∂^u∂ah^a <σ - ◻h_vσ - ∂v∂σ h
        Now we will calculate the Ricci scalar which is
        R = R^v <v
        Again, we can use the inverse metric to lower raise indices, and remove terms that go to 0.
        Doing this simple process, we get
        R = ∂u∂σ h^uσ -  ◻h
        Now we can compute the einstein field equations in weak gravity:
        Guv = Ruv - 1/2 guv R =
        => ∂a∂u h^a <v + ∂v∂a h^a <u - _◻huv - ∂u∂v h
        ul.part => - 1/2 g_uv (∂a∂b h^ab - ◻h) =
        => - 1/2 (nuv + huv) (∂a∂b h^ab - ◻h ) =
        = - 1/2 nuv (∂a∂b h^ab - ◻h)
        ==> 0
        
        mag(h^ab)<<1
        mag(∂u∂v h^ab)<<1
        
        After some LENGTHY derivation, which i don't feel like writing down, we get that
        = 1/2 (∂^a ∂u h_av + ∂^a ∂<v h_ua - ◻h_uv - ∂u∂v h - nuv ∂^a ∂b h_ab + nuv◻h )
        => ℏ_uv = huv - 1/2 nuv h 
        ==> *h_uv = ℏ_uv + 1/2 nuv h
        
        Just as quick reminder of exchange of summation indices:
        ∂u h_uv
        => ∂u n^ua** h_a ^v 
        => ∂^a h_a ^v
        aswell as
        ∂u h^uv
        => ∂^a h_a ^v
        
        This is the end of the derivation of the einstein field equations in weak gravity
        In the next note thingy we will cover the lorentz gauge, and after that the transeverse traceless gauge
