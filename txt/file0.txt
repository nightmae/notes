                Curvature on p-Riemann Manifold can be divided into:
                The riemann curvature tensor (R^a bys)
                Ricci curvature tensor (R<uv),
                and the Ricci scalar tensor (R^a <a).
                
                Holonomy measures flatness, If there is Holonomy the surface is curved, if not the opposite.
                
                The Riemann curvature tensor is a function that takes in 3 inputs, for example R(V,W)T, Those are V,W and T vectors. 
                Its output vector measures how much T has changed after a pararell transport.
                
                \[R(V,W)T = ∇<v ∇<w * T - ∇<w ∇<v T - ∇<[v,w] T\]
                If R(V,W)T = 0, there is no curvature.
                if its not 0, then the opposite.
                [[R(eu, ev)eσ = R^p σuv ep ]]
                
                R(eu, ev)eσ = ∇<eu ∇<ev eσ - ∇<ev ∇<eu eσ - ∇<[eu,ev]eσ 
                
                R^p <σuv ep = (∂u(Γ^p <vσ) -∂v(Γ^p <uv) + Γ^a <vsigma Γ^p <ua - Γ^b ua Γ^p vb) ep
                
                ∇vV = 0->
                (-> means it is a vector)
                
                ∇T∇<vV = 0->
                ∇v∇v∇T = -R(T,V)V->
                
                On curved manifolds, geodescis can naturally come together or spread apart.
                Now we move onto the Ricci Tensor,
                # [[R(a,b) = (Σ<p) R^p <apb]]
                
                The Ricci tensor is symmetric, so if you take R(a,b) it is equal to R(b,a). 
                It is a summation of the Riemann curvature tensor
                
                Ric(V,W) => Scalar
                Ric(V,V) = v^a v^b R<ab
                
                # [[[∇v∇v (volumen) = Ric(V,V) * volumen ]]]
                # A converging geodesic:
                -object shrinks
                -Ric(V,V) > 0
                # A diverging geodesic:
                -object increases in size
                -Ric(V,V) < 0
                # if None:
                -area and volume stay the same
                - RVV = 0
                
                Since The ricci tensor is a summation of the riemann curvature tensor, if R<ab = 0, it does not mean spacetime is flat. 
                (As shown in the previous examples, it means a and v dont change due to curvature)
                
                # -R = g^ub * R<ab = Σ(infinity) R^a <a
                
                Lets take a flat circle, you remember this from 8th grade mathematics:
                c = 2PI r
                A = PIr^2
                A curved circle would have the same c, but a different area.
                
                Lets take R>0 in Flat spacetime and Curved Spacetime:
                If it has the same circumference, in flat spacetime it has less area, but in curv. it has more area.
                If it has the same radius, it has more area in flat s., but less A

                in Curved spacetime.
                If # R=0, it's the same everywhere.

                #R^t <xtx = ∂~t(x/D^2) - ∂~X (1/X) + 0 -(1/x)(1/x~)
                ~ after a symbol means we are using it in the rindler coordinates and not the standard coordinate system.

                We are now moving onto Newton Cartan theory, which is newtonian gravity for general relativity.
                **Remember the following!!**
                p = rho, too lazy to copy it from google everytime, remember that.
                # R<00 = 4πGp

                # ∇^2 * φ = R<00
                ∇^2 φ <-- This is called a ***Laplacian***

                [if ∇^2 > 0, vectors are leaving the box
                if ∇^2 = 0, no vectors are entering or leaving, 
                and if ∇^2 < 0, vectors are entering the box.]

                You remember that g-> is equal to G(M/r^2)(er->) from 7th grade physics class,
                # ∇g-> is equal to the Ricci tensor of lower bounds 00 (4<00)

                **we are now moving onto the  Gravitational potential scalar, fi (φ) **
                ∇(-∇φ) = R<00, or 4piGp
                thus
                # (∇)(∇φ) = R<00

                mass density p is always greater than or equal to 0, thus the laplacian is always greater than or equal to 0.

                ok so you know how, 
                ma-> = Fg->
                ma-> = mg->
                a-> = g->

                i didnt write notes on this, but i am pretty sure it means gravity is affected by acceleration or something

                the second derivative of x over t (d^2 x / dt^2) is equal to the Laplacian
                if we change it to d^2 x^i (i being the coordinates x,y and z) / dt we get
                = - ∂φ/∂x^i = 0 (we did a rather long derivation for this, i dont feel like writing it out jus trust me)

                if we make λ = t, and σ = 0 => the connection coefficient with upper bound σ, <uv is equal to 0.
                # Γ^ i < 00 = ∂φ/∂x^i => 0
                Lower index sigma must be 0, upper p must be i.

                # R^i <0uv = [∂u (Γ^i <v0) - ∂v (Γ^i <u0)], the other terms we would get from the formula go to 0.

                if we take that
                a) u = 0, we get
                R^i <000 = 0

                b) u = j, v = 0, 
                # R^i <0j0 = ∂i∂jφ 

                c) u = j, v = k ,
                R^i <ojk = 0

                # Spherical potential for a star:
                # φ = -(GM/r), r=sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

                #∂i∂jφ = (GM/r^5) (r^2 δ^ij - 3x^i x^j)

                ∇v∇vT = ∇<T

                ∇<T = R(T,V)V->
                v = e0->  ==> Geodesic in time direction
                T = ej-> ==> Seperation in space

                Riemann Curvature tensor in newtonian gravity:
                R^i <0j0 = **-R^i 00j = [[∂i∂jφ]]
                φij = [[∂i∂jφ]] ====> Tidal Tensor
                Summation of the Ricci Curvature tensor:
                R>ab = Σ(u) R^u <aub
                
                R<00 = R^u <0u0 =
                => d^2φ/dx^2 + d^2φ/dy^2 + d^2φ/dz^2 >, or equal to 0
                
                R<00 = R<tt = 4πGp (Laplacian)
                
                mass density creates a potential "well" (laplacian)
                the "well" causes time-pointing geodescics to converge Rtt (Shrink volume)
                
                inside earth: p>equal 0
                outside: p = 0
                R<00 approx = 0
                
                R<uv can NOT detect changes in shape, only volume.
                IT can NOT see tidal forces acting on objects in geodesics being pararell transported.
