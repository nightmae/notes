        In this lecture we're going to give an introduction to the idea of gravitational waves, and the wave equation.
        In future thingy's we will derive linearzed gravity and the transverse traceless gauge
        
        We will discuss how the einstein field equations naturally lead to the equation for gravitationa waves which travel at the speed of light c
        
        We will review waves first, informally, a wave is a distrubance that propogates in a medium, it can travel accross a string or a body of water.
        A gravitational wave is a disturbance in the spacetime metric that propagates through spacetime, making spacetime strecth and compress.
        
        wobble == acceleration
        => ∂^2 A / dx^2
        where A is amplitude
        
        Gravitational waves are caused by a wobble in mass-energy/momentum
        The Sun-Earth system produces gravitational waves, but they are undetectable, and extremely extremely weak
        Binary compact systems such as white-dwarf systems and black hole systems also produce gravitational waves
        
        Gravitational radiation leads to energy loss in these systems
        The strength of these waves does get weaker over time, a relatively weak change can be detected by the LIGO detector or other detectors.
        
        These detectors basically work by using an interferometer (device that measures interference between light beams), and a light source which shoots light beams into a beam splitter, which separates the waves into 2 different mirrors which come back and hit the detector, something like that.
        
        The wave equation is
        v^2 ∂^2 (A) / ∂x^2 = ∂^2A/∂t^2
        A(t,x) = wave amplitude
        v = wave velocity
        
        A(t,x) = A_0 cos(wt |kx x|)
        w is the angular frequency
        kx is the angular wave number
        if we use -, we get a positive x direction, and + is a negative x direction 
        
        I don't feel like writing down all the derivation, but we get that
        v = w/k_x
        after some derivationm, which was pretty long
        The first image is a x-wave with a constant t, more sharply curved means higher ∂^2A/∂x^2
        The second image shows a t-wave with a constant x, less curved means lower ∂^2A/∂t^2
        
        Keep in mind that v^2 is pretty small
        
        The wave equations in 3D:
        v^2 (∂^2 A / ∂x^2) = (∂^2 A / ∂t^2)
        => ∂^2A/∂x^2 = 1/v^2 (∂^2 A / ∂t^2)
        
        ∂^2 A / ∂(x)^2 + # ∂^2 A / ∂(y)^2 + # ∂^2 A / ∂(z)^2  = ∇*∇(A)
        ∇∇(A) = 1/v^2 (∂^2 A / ∂t^2)
        => ∇^2(A) = 1/v^2 (∂^2 A / ∂t^2)
        
        Now we'll talk about maxwell's equations in a vacuum for a bit:
        ∇ E = ρ/ε_0 (-> goes to zero)
        ∇ x E = -(∂B/∂t)
        ∇ * B = 0
        ∇ x B = u_0J (also goes to 0) + u_0e_0 (∂E/∂t)
        i don't feel like discussing electromagnetic wave equation, as it is insane,
        but the d'Alemebrt operator is basically
        =>  (∂<u ∂^u)E = 0
        =>  □E = 0
         □ ≡ ∂<u ∂^u ≡ n<uv (∂<u ∂^u)
        n<uv in this case is the inverse minkowski metric
        
        The d'alembertian operator is pretty similar to the laplacian operator, here's an example:
        Δ ≡ ∇^2 ≡ ∂^2 A / ∂(x)^2 + # ∂^2 A / ∂(y)^2 + # ∂^2 A / ∂(z)^2
        □ ≡ ∂^2 A / ∂(ct)^2  + ∂^2 A / ∂(x)^2 + # ∂^2 A / ∂(y)^2 + # ∂^2 A / ∂(z)^2
