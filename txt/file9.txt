        Gravitational wave derivation
        We derived the einstein field equations in the previous note thingy
        We can do a change of coorinate systems that sets all terms to 0 except the d'Alembertain of h
        
        This basically shows that a metric obeys a wave equation in the vacuum where Tuv = 0
        At the end, ill explain what a gauge is.
        
        
        Guv = 1/2 (∂^a ∂u ℏav + ∂^a ∂v ℏua - nuv ∂^a ∂^b ℏab - ∂^a ∂a ℏuv)
        if ∂bℏ^ab is 0, then the first 3 terms are 0
        I wont show the derivation, but the first 3 terms do go to 0.
        
        This is the Lorenz Gauge, it's the first three terms in the einstein tensor going to 0.
        "how do we find a coordinate system for ∂bℏ^ab = 0?"
        For this we need a coordinate transformation, 
        We will start by getting a displacement field xi~, which is basically a vector displacement field.
        
        it is not some insane displacement like
        ~x^a = x^a + ξ^a
        it is a very small displacement, like
        mag(ξ) << 1
        
        That's why we will also assume it's derivatives are small
        mag(dξ^a/dx^b) << 1
        
        to get x^a --> ~x^a
        we use x^a = ~x^a - ξ^a
        And then we get:
        ∂~x^a/∂x^b = ∂x^a/∂x^b + ∂ξ^a/∂x^b = δ^a <b +  ∂ξ^a/∂x^b 
        ∂x^a/∂~x^b = ∂~x^a/∂~x^b - ∂ξ^a/∂~x^b = δ^a <b - ∂ξ^a/∂x^b ∂x^σ/∂x^b
        
        After long derivation, we get that
        ∂x^a/∂~x^b = δ^a <b - ∂ξ^a/∂x^b
        Where the derivative's of xi are very small, so we can approximate them to basically 0.
        
        Metric change of coordinates:
        ~g_ab = ea * eb = ∂/∂~x^a * (∂/∂~x^b) = ∂x^u/∂x^a * ∂/∂x^u ** ∂x^v/∂~x^a * ∂/∂x^v
        ... some long derivation
        ~g_ab = (δ^u <a -  ∂ξ^u/∂x^a)(δ^v <a -  ∂ξ^v/∂x^b)(nuv + huv)
        After an even longer derivation, we get that:
        ~g_ab = g_ab - ξa,b - ξb,a
        So by this logic, we also get that:
        h_ab = h_ab -  ξa,b - ξb,a 
        
        We can expand this term, to calculate the Riemannian curvature tensor
        ~R^p σuv = 1/2 n^pa (∂u∂σ ~h_av - ∂u∂a ~h_vσ - ∂v∂σ h_au + ∂v∂a h_uσ)
        We can expand the terms, but im not going to do that
        
        So we get this as a final result:
        ~R^p σuv = 1/2 n^pa (∂u∂σ h_av - ∂u∂a h_vσ - ∂v∂σ ~h_au + ∂v∂a ~h_uσ) = R^p σuv
        
        ∂ξ^a / ∂~x^u = ∂ξ^a/∂x^v * ∂x^v/∂~x^u = ∂ξ^a/∂x^v δ^v _u - ∂ξ^a/∂x^v ∂ξ^a/∂x^u = 
        = ∂ξ^a/∂x^u
        This means that Riemannian tensor components don't change if we add a small displacement field xi
        Our primary goal now is to change to the Lorenz Gauge
        
        We will introduce new notation, as ~-h is maybe too hard to read, well say it is equal to ~ℏ
        ~h_uv = h_uv - ξu,v - ξu,v
        ~ℏ_uv = h_uv - ξu,v - ξu,v + n^uv ξ^σ ,<σ 
        
        ~ℏ^ab = ℏ^ab - n^ua n^vb ξu,v  - n^ua n^vb ξv,u + n^ab ξ^σ ,<σ
        ~ℏ^ab, <b = ℏ^ab, <b - n^vb ∂v∂b ξ^a
        So we get that:
        ∂b ~ℏ^ab == ℏ^ab - ◻ξ^a == 0 
        Choose ξ^a such that ℏ^ab = ◻ξ^a
        ∂b ~ℏ^ab Is part of the Lorenz Gauge
        
        
        The choice of ξ^a is not unique.
        Any χ^a with ◻χ^a = 0 Will also solve:
        ℏ^ab = ◻(ξ^a + χ^a) ===◻ξ^a +◻χ^a = ◻ξ^a
        
        The Lorenz Gauge is more of a class of coordinate systems, not just one coordinate system.
        If ∂b ~ℏ^ab With Weak Gravity, the Lorenz Gauge, and Vacuum ~T_uv = 0, the first 3 terms go to 0.
        So we get the following:
        
        #~G_uv = 8πG/c^4 * ~T_uv
        ◻ℏ_uv = 0
        => Wave Equation
        
        If we know that ~g_uv = n_uv + ~h_uv
        and ~ℏ_uv = ~h_uv - 1/2 n_uv ℏ
        We can get:
        
        1/c^2 (∂^2 ~ℏ_uv / ∂t^2) == ∇^2 ~ℏ_uv
        By the way:
        -Gravitational waves exist in all coordinate systems,
        -Coordinate systems are made by humans,
        -Coordinate choice has no impact on real physics, basically,
        
        
        Now to cover the Lorenz Gauge in electricity n' magnetism, and how it relates to the L.G in G.R
        
        A Gauge Is basically the choice we have the freedom to make
        So as you know, different potentials result in the same  electric field
        (Same Physics)
        E = -∇
        E = -∇(Φ + k)
        E = -∇ - 0
        
        E = -∇Φ
        
        B = ∇ x a
        F_B = q(v x B)
        Different Potentials result in the Same Magnetic Field
        B = ∇ x a
        B = ∇ x (a + ∇f)
        => ∇ x a
        
        Combining the electric potential scalar fi, and the magnetic potential vector a, we get the
        4-Potential vector A
        We can also expand this into the 4-Potential co-vector, but i will not cover that.
        
        But basically,
        A_i = -a^i
        A_t = Φ/c
        
        E_x/c = -∂xA_t + ∂ctA_x
        B_x/c -∂yA_z + ∂zA_y
        Combining E_x/y/z, aswell as B_x/y/z, we get 
        The Faraday Tesnor F_uv
        Which we can display in matrix notation like this: 2nd image
        
        Different potentials result in the same Faraday Tensor (same physics)
        F_uv = ∂uA_v - ∂v_Au
        Freedom to pick A_u is called Gauge Freedom
        Choosing a specific A_u is called a Gauge
        Changing from one A_u in a way that F_uv doesn't change is called a Gauge Transformation
