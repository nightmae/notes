        Derivation of the einstein field equations
        If you remember, Pc^2 = T^00

        And The Laplacian (∇^2Φ) is equal to 4πGp
        p in this cause is mass density rho; i am too lazy to copy the symbol

        This means that R<00 = 4πGT<00
        so Ruv = 4πGTuv

        We will say that The einstein tensor Guv is equal to negative KTuv
        Guv = -KTuv
        ∇uT^uv is divergent
        [g^uv Tuv = T^u <v] <- Example of raising a bound
        [g<uv T^uv = T<u ^v] <- Example of lowering a bound/index

        R^uv = KT^uv
        => ∇uR^uv can not equal 0
        K in this case is the greek symbol "Kappa"

        Ruv = 1/2Rg^uv = KTuv
        => this is the formula for the Einstein Tensor (Guv)

        ∇uGuv = 0
        If we take the cosmological constant Λ, which was equal to 0 when einstein wrote his paper on general relativity, we get that
        => ∇u [G^uv +- Λguv] = 0
        g<uv in any direction is 0.

        [ G^uv - Λg^uv] = KT^uv
        The region in the brackets predicts spacetime curavture.

        in this lecture, we are going to:
        a) Prove ∇u(Λguv) = 0
        b) Prove ∇uGuv = 0
        c) Derive the proportionality constant K = (8πG) / (c^4)
        d) derive the schwarzschild radius from the einstein field equations (left as an exercise for the reader)

        a) if you remember from the previous lecture, V<T(VW) = 0
        if you also remember, e<a is equal to partial derivative of a, these are interchangable
        => V<ea (eu ev) = (∇<ev eu) * ev + eu * (∇<ea ea) =
        = ∂<a (eu * ev) = Γ^σ <au (ev * eσ) + Γ^σ <av (eu * eσ) =
        =∂(guv) = Γ^σ <au gσv + Γ^σ <av guσ
        after some more derivation we get that
        [0 = aσv^v (Ω^σ <uv + Γ^σ <uv)]
        b)
        If you remember, R<uvpσ = +Rpσuv, and
        => [R^p <σuv + R^p <vσu + R^p uvσ = 0]
        In Riemannian normal coordinates,
        guv = nuv at point p, and
         Γ^σ <uv = 0 at point p

        ==>  ∂a∂u (Γ^p <vσ) - ∂a∂u (Γ^p <uσ) at point p
         [R^p <σuvja + R^p <σaujv + R^p σvaju = 0] 

        g^σv (Rσvja - Rσaujv - Rσvaju) = 0
        g^σv  (R^v <vja - R^v ajv - R^ u <aju) = 0
         Rja = 2R^u <aj = 0 
         [1/2 Rja - R^u <aju = 0]
        [R^uv <ju - 1/2 g^uv Rju = 0]
        c) Guv - Λguv = KT^uv
        => ∇u(Λguv) = 0
        => ∇u(T^uv) = 0 
        We will take a low velocity limit => [v<<<c]
        if you remember from special relativity Beta is a fraction of the speed of light so
        => B = u/c = 0
        => y=1
        => proper time tau = t
        We will also take the weak gravitational limit => [guv approx = nuv + huv]
        => nuv = diag(+1, -1, +1, -1)
        ||huv| <1
        We will also assume Time independece of ∂tauguv = ∂0 guv = 0

        We will get that Ruv = -1/2 Rδuvj, T00 = pc^2 j, Tuv = 0
        -r = Kpc^2 ==> 2R00

        2 1/c^2 (∇^2φ) = K (If you remember the Laplacian is equal to 4πGp)
        K = 8πG/c^4
        We will derive the equations further to get R = -4Λ - kT

        Ruv = 1/2Rguv - Λguv = kT^uv
         [Ruvg^uv - 1/2Rguv g^uv - Λδ^u <u = kT^u <u ]
        R - 1/2R4 - Λ4 = kT
        R - 2R - 4Λ = kT
        R = -4Λ - kT
        Ruv = K(Tuv - 1/2 Tguv) - Λguv ==> [Ruv - 1/2Rguv - Λguv] = 8πG/c^4 T = Guv - Λguv = 8πG/c^4 T**
